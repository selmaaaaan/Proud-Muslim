            <h1>Generosity of the Heart</h1>
            <p class="subtitle">Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was known for his boundless generosity, inspiring a culture of
                giving within the community. His selflessness, extending beyond material wealth, strengthened bonds and
                earned Allah’s pleasure.</p>

        <section class="content-layout">
            <div class="text-content">
                <h1>Story</h1>
                <p>The Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was unmatched in his generosity. One example highlights this quality: a
                    man came to the Prophet (PBUH) seeking help, and he was given so much that he exclaimed, “You have
                    given me like someone who does not fear poverty!” This selfless generosity inspired others to follow
                    suit, creating a culture of giving within the community.

                    The Prophet’s (PBUH) generosity was not limited to material wealth. He gave his time, kindness, and
                    guidance to everyone, regardless of their status. His actions remind us that giving, in all its
                    forms, strengthens community bonds and pleases Allah.
                </p>
                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>Generosity is not just about wealth—it’s about the willingness to share whatever we have, whether
                    it’s time, skills, or emotional support. How often do we prioritize giving over receiving? The
                    Prophet’s (PBUH) example encourages us to adopt a mindset of abundance, trusting that Allah will
                    replenish what we give.
                </p>
                <h1>Application</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong> Donate or Help Someone in Need:</strong> Identify a way to give back today. This could
                    include donating to a
                    charity, volunteering your time, or helping a friend or neighbor with something they need.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong> Practice Daily Generosity:</strong> Make generosity a daily habit. Even small acts, like
                    sharing a kind word or offering assistance, can have a big impact.

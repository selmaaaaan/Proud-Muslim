                <h1>Story</h1>
                <p>When the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his companions migrated to Medina, the Ansar (locals of Medina)
                    set a remarkable example of love and unity. They welcomed the Muhajirun (migrants from Mecca) with
                    open arms, sharing their homes, wealth, and resources without hesitation. Some even went to the
                    extent of giving preference to the Muhajirun over themselves, exemplifying the Quranic verse:

                    "They give [them] preference over themselves, even though they are in privation." (Quran 59:9)

                    This bond of mutual sacrifice and generosity became a shining example of unity, demonstrating the
                    strength of sisterhood and brotherhood in Islam. It reminds us that true community spirit is built
                    on love, support, and selflessness.
                </p>
                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>The Ansar’s actions inspire us to reflect on how we treat those in need within our own communities.
                    Are we willing to share what we have and prioritize others over ourselves? Their story teaches us
                    that unity is strengthened when generosity and kindness are at the forefront of our actions.
                </p>
                <h1>Application</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Perform a Kind Act:</strong> Identify someone in your community who could use support,
                    whether emotionally,
                    financially, or socially. Perform a kind act for them today. This could be sharing a meal, offering
                    to help with a task, or simply showing them compassion and understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Foster Unity:</strong> Actively work to bridge gaps within your community. Reach out to
                    someone you haven’t connected with recently and offer a gesture of friendship.

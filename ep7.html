                <h1>Story</h1>
                <p>Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab (RA) was renowned for his commitment to justice, fairness, and
                    accountability. One notable instance during his caliphate illustrates this: Umar (RA) learned about
                    a family in need and personally carried food on his back to provide for them. When questioned about
                    why he did not delegate the task, he responded, “I will be questioned about them on the Day of
                    Judgment.”

                    This story highlights the importance of taking personal responsibility and ensuring justice,
                    regardless of one’s status or position. Umar’s (RA) humility and fairness made him a model leader
                    whose legacy continues to inspire.


                </p>
                <h1>Reflection</h1>
                <p>Justice and integrity are central to living a life that pleases Allah. Umar’s (RA) actions prompt us
                    to ask: Are we fair and just in our dealings with others? Do we take responsibility for those who
                    depend on us? Justice begins with small, everyday actions and extends to our roles within our
                    families, workplaces, and communities.
                </p>
                <h1>Application</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Act Justly:</strong> Identify an area in your life where you can improve fairness. This
                    might be resolving a
                    conflict impartially, treating colleagues or family members equitably, or ensuring transparency in
                    your dealings.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Take Responsibility:</strong> Reflect on the needs of those around you and take tangible
                    steps to address them. This could include helping a neighbor, mentoring someone in need, or
                    supporting a charitable cause.
